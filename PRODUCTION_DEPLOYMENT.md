# Production Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Banking Dashboard - Production Ready

Your banking dashboard is now fully configured for production deployment with enterprise-grade security and performance optimizations.

## ✅ Production Features Implemented

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Required Firebase config validation with helpful error messages
- **Production Firebase Config**: Real Firebase project credentials (no more demo defaults)
- **Security Headers**: CSP, XSS protection, and frame options configured
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production builds enforce secure connections
- **Session Management**: 30-minute timeout for banking security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunking for React, Firebase, Router, and UI libraries
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code eliminated in production builds
- **Minification**: Terser minification for smallest bundle sizes
- **Source Maps**: Available for production debugging
- **Modern Browser Support**: ES2020 target for optimal performance
- **Bundle Analysis**: Built-in bundle analyzer for optimization

### 🏗️ Build Configuration
- **Production Build**: Optimized for deployment (`npm run build`)
- **Preview Server**: Test production builds locally (`npm run preview`)
- **Type Checking**: Full TypeScript validation (`npm run type-check`)
- **Linting**: ESLint with auto-fix capabilities (`npm run lint:fix`)
