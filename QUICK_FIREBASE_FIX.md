# Quick Firebase Storage Fix - No SDK Required!

## Method 1: Firebase Console (Easiest - 2 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Storage Rules
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/e-bank-dashboard/storage/rules
2. Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /branding/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

### Step 2: Test Upload
1. Go back to your System Settings
2. Try uploading a logo
3. Should work immediately!

## Method 2: Alternative - Use Firebase Emulator (Development)

If you prefer to keep strict rules in production:

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Run: `firebase login`
3. Run: `firebase init storage` 
4. Use emulator for development: `firebase emulators:start --only storage`

## Current Status
- ✅ System Settings: Working
- ✅ Database Save: Working  
- ⚠️ Logo Upload: Needs rules update
- ✅ File Selection: Working with validation

## Quick Test
After updating rules, test by:
1. Selecting a small image file in System Settings
2. Clicking "Save Settings"
3. Should see "Logo uploaded successfully!"
